  Outside of class, my portfolio website was another main focus of my project time recently. It was built using the Gatsby.js framework. This project represents a lot of growth for me. I know I still have a very long way to go, but this program reminds me of how far I have come. Working with a framework like Gatsby requires a grasp of all of the layers beneath it. Fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript are essential. Comfort using the command line, git, and package managers like npm are required. The ability to dive into configuration files and understand and customize them. I also had the chance on this project to do a little design, with tools like AdobeXD and Photoshop, to create some of the elements used in the site.

  Ultimately, this is just a starting point I intend for this project to be something that 
will constantly evolve, change, and improve as my skills as a developer grow. After deploying 
the site, I immediately saw some things that didn't quite work like I wanted, or look like 
I wanted. So back to infinitely expanding whiteboard :)
